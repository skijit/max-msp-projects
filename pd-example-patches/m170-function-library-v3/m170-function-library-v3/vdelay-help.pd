#X text 253 126 delays the incoming signal by a delay time in seconds.
The delay time entered in the number box is added to the right-hand
side input to computer the delay time to use. The left-hand input is
the signal to be delayed. In this example \, a sinusoid is added to
a delayed copy of itself., f 43;
