bandwidth is "peak"/"Q" \, so for example if "peak" is 1000 and "Q"
is 10 \, the bandwidth is 100;
#X text 218 322 Caution: the amplitude of the output increases when
Q decreases - turn down the output before re-setting Q from 100 to
0 \, say.;

\, allowing frequencies near the "peak" (given in Hz.) to pass through
but attenuating others.;
